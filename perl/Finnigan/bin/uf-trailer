=head1 NAME

uf-index - decode the ScanIndexEntry structures in a Finnigan raw file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

uf-index [options] file

 Options:

  -a[ll]                        list all existing index entries
  -n[unmber] <n>                get one index entry number <n>
  -range <from> .. <to>         list all entries with numbers between <from> and <to>
  -d[ump]                       dump a single index entry 
  -s[ize]                       print record size 
  -h[tml]                       dump as html 
  -w[iki]                       dump in wiki table format 
  -r[elative]                   show relative addersess in dump 
  -f[ormat] <type>              format the unknown long as 'bin', 'hex', or 'ms' (for MS level)
  <file>                        input file 

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Print a brief help message and exits.

=item B<-d[ump]>

Prints a table listing all fields in a single index entry, with
their seek addresses, sizes, names and values. The entry is selected
with the -n[umber] option.

=item B<-n[umber]>

Gives the number of the ScanIndexEntry to dump (works with the -d[ump]
option)

=item B<-r[ange]>

Selects a range of the ScanIndexEntry records to print as a table
(does not work with the -d[ump] option)

=item B<-h[tml]>

Dump a single entry as html table.

=item B<-w[iki]>

Dump a single entry as a wiki table.

=item B<-s[ize]>

Show structure size in bytes (works with the -d[ump] option).

=item B<-r[elative]>

Show relative addresses of all itmes in the dump. The default is to
show the absolute seek address. (works with the -d[ump] option)

=item B<-a[ll]>

Print all existing index entries. It appears as though it may be
possible to see more index entries in the file than would fit between
the first and the last scan numbers specified in SampleInfo. In that
case, in the absence of the --all option, ScanIndex will be treated as
a linked list, starting with the entry whose index matches first scan
number.

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<uf-index> can be used to dump the scan index entries from a Finnigan
raw file.

By default, the entries are listed in a tabular format. Use the -n option to re

=head2 EXAMPLES

uf-index  sample.raw 

  (will print all index entries in the file in a tabular form)

uf-index -range 1..5 sample.raw

  (will print the first five records)

uf-index -range 1..5 -format bin sample.raw

  (will show individual bits in the scan type word)

uf-index -rdsn 5 ~/shared/test/sample4.raw 

  (will dump the fifth index entry with relative addresses and will
   show its size)

=cut
